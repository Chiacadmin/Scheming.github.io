# Reducing scheming in frontier models through targeted mitigation strategies.

 ##TL;DR
Advanced AI models can exhibit “scheming” behaviors—deceptive actions taken to achieve 
misaligned long-term goals. Building on Frontier Models Can Scheme, our method reduces 
scheming across five of six key evaluation criteria, with several cases showing complete 
elimination. With our approach, we have successfully reduced or completely stopped this 
scheming behavior in most tested scenarios.
